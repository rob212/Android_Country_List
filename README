Android Country List

A simple Android Application to create a list of View's each comprising of the image of a countries flag and the name of the corresponding country. 

This list is currently populated via arrays within the app for the purpose of this demo. Future work can be done to read these from a database or online service. 

The ListView has a bespoke Adapter and uses the the ViewHolder pattern in order to allow for smooth scrolling through the list of items. 

Please feel free to comment or make further suggestions to improve the program. I intend to do further work as a means of learning more about Android development.

Rob.
